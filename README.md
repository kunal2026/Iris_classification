# Iris Classification Project
#### This repository contains code and resources for classifying iris flowers into three species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on their sepal and petal measurements.

## Dataset
#### The dataset used for this project is the famous Iris dataset, which is included in many machine learning libraries and repositories. It consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing the following features:

Sepal length
Sepal width
Petal length
Petal width
The dataset is typically split into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the classification model.

## Code
#### The main script for this project is iris_classification.ipynb, which performs the following steps:

Data Loading: Loads the Iris dataset from a CSV file.
Data Preprocessing: Performs basic preprocessing steps such as:
Scaling the features.
Encoding the categorical target variable.
Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
Model Training: Trains a classification model on the training set. In this repository, we use a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, but other classifiers such as logistic regression or decision trees could also be used.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the trained model on the testing set using accuracy metrics and confusion matrix.
Prediction: Provides functionality to make predictions on new data points using the trained model.

## Results
#### The SVM classifier achieves an accuracy of approximately 96.67% on the test set, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model in classifying iris flowers based on their measurements.
